## Get started in three steps

Integrate Sentinel into your application and start tracking API analytics immediately.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create your Sentinel account">
  <a href="https://usesentinel.dev/sign-up">Sign up</a> for a Sentinel account to get started.
</Step>

<Step title="Create your API key">
  Create your API key from the dashboard and set it to the `SENTINEL_API_KEY`
  environment variable.
  <Warning>
    Store your API key safely. Never commit it to version control.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Install one of the SDKs">
  Install the Sentinel SDK for your framework, or check our <a href="/api-reference/ingestion/introduction">API reference</a> to manually send events if your framework isn't covered.

## Verify it's working

After adding the middleware, make a few requests to your API. You should see events appearing in your Sentinel dashboard within seconds.

<Check>
  Events are automatically batched and sent to the ingestion API, so you may see
  a slight delay before they appear in the dashboard.
</Check>
