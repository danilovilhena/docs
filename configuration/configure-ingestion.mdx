You can configure data collection, filtering, and privacy settings for your project by navigating to **Settings** → **Configuration** within your project dashboard.

## Request and response body capture

### Capture request body

Enable this option to capture and store the full request body content in event data for debugging and analysis.

<Tip>
  Capturing request bodies is useful for debugging API issues, but be mindful of
  privacy and data protection requirements. Sensitive data can be masked using
  the masking options below.
</Tip>

### Capture response body

Enable this option to capture and store the full response body content in event data for complete request-response tracking.

<Warning>
  Response bodies may contain sensitive information. Ensure you configure
  appropriate masking rules before enabling this option in production.
</Warning>

## IP address filtering

### Exclude localhost

Enable this option to prevent event collection from requests originating from localhost IP addresses (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`).

<Info>
  This is useful for excluding development and testing traffic from your
  production analytics.
</Info>

### Excluded IP addresses

Specify IP addresses that will be completely excluded from event collection. This is useful for blocking noisy sources or internal testing IPs.

You can add multiple IP addresses, one per line. For example:

```
192.168.1.1
10.0.0.5
172.16.0.1
```

<Tip>
  Add your current development machine's IP address to prevent your local
  testing traffic from being tracked.
</Tip>

## Field masking

### Masked field names

Specify field names that will be automatically masked (replaced with asterisks) in request and response bodies to protect sensitive information like passwords, tokens, and API keys.

You can add multiple field names. Common examples include:

- `password`
- `token`
- `authorization`
- `set-cookie`
- `apiKey`
- `secret`

<Warning>
  Field name masking is case-sensitive and matches exact field names at the root
  level of the request/response body.
</Warning>

### Masked JSON paths

Use JSONPath expressions to mask specific nested fields in request/response bodies. Use dot notation to target deeply nested values.

Examples:

- `user.email` - Masks the email field within a user object
- `order.card.number` - Masks the card number in a nested order structure
- `credentials.apiKey` - Masks API keys in nested credential objects
- `data.user.password` - Masks passwords at any nesting level

<Tip>
  JSONPath expressions allow you to mask sensitive data even when it's nested
  deep within complex JSON structures, providing more granular control than
  field name masking.
</Tip>

## Header masking

Control which HTTP headers are automatically masked to protect sensitive authentication and session data.

### Mask cookies

Enable this option to automatically mask all cookie-related headers (`Set-Cookie`, `Cookie`) to protect session information.

<Check>
  Cookie masking is recommended for all production environments to protect user
  session data.
</Check>

### Mask authorization

Enable this option to automatically mask the `Authorization` header to protect API keys, tokens, and credentials.

### Custom masked headers

Specify additional custom headers that should be automatically masked in all events. Common examples include:

- `X-API-Key`
- `X-Auth-Token`
- `X-Session-Token`
- `X-API-Secret`

You can add multiple headers, one per line. Header names are case-insensitive.

<Info>
  Custom headers are masked regardless of whether cookie or authorization
  masking is enabled, giving you full control over which headers contain
  sensitive information.
</Info>
