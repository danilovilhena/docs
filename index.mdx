description: "Monitor your API with one line of code."

## What is Sentinel?

Sentinel is meant to be the **easiest way to monitor your API**. We aim to support the major frameworks with **one line of code** and a couple of environment variables.

Track response times, request/response metrics, monitor performance, and gain insights into your API usage **without complex setup**.

## What motivated me to build Sentinel?

Setting up API monitoring tools like Prometheus and other industry giants can be **incredibly complex and time-consuming**.

Many teams find themselves **spending more resources trying to configure and maintain these systems** than actually benefiting from them.

Sometimes, teams prefer not to waste their resources trying to set this up than trying to figure out how to set up Prometheus properly in their API.

So, I decided it was time that we had a simple tool that we could **plug and play with minimal effort** and it could monitor your API. Then, view useful dashboards, extract metrics, and get insights into your API usage.

## How it works

When using one of our custom SDKs, Sentinel integrates directly into the request lifecycle of your application.

For example, if you're using Express, we provide middleware that gathers data before the request runs and after it returns, capturing metrics from both stages.

Sentinel automatically collects metrics and sends them to our ingestion API.

Events are queued in Redis, processed by workers, and stored in ClickHouse for real-time analytics.
